This excel file is about Melbourne Housing
Here we have focus on the various factors reflecting high sales price of a house and how could we improve the factors to make house selling more profitable and systematic
I have calculated total revenue, average housing price, popular method of selling house, popular type of building, top 10 sellers and highest month of sales.
I have also calculated top 10 house whose distance from CBD and average price is greater than or equal to 1000000.
